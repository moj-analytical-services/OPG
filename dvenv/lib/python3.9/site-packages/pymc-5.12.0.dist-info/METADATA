PyMC (formerly PyMC3) is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling
focusing on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI)
algorithms. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a
large suite of problems.

Check out the `PyMC overview <https://docs.pymc.io/en/latest/learn/core_notebooks/pymc_overview.html>`__,  or
one of `the many examples <https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html>`__!
For questions on PyMC, head on over to our `PyMC Discourse <https://discourse.pymc.io/>`__ forum.

Features
========

-  Intuitive model specification syntax, for example, ``x ~ N(0,1)``
   translates to ``x = Normal('x',0,1)``
-  **Powerful sampling algorithms**, such as the `No U-Turn
   Sampler <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/hoffman14a.html>`__, allow complex models
   with thousands of parameters with little specialized knowledge of
   fitting algorithms.
-  **Variational inference**: `ADVI <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v18/16-107.html>`__
   for fast approximate posterior estimation as well as mini-batch ADVI
   for large data sets.
-  Relies on `PyTensor <https://pytensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ which provides:
    *  Computation optimization and dynamic C or JAX compilation
    *  NumPy broadcasting and advanced indexing
    *  Linear algebra operators
    *  Simple extensibility
-  Transparent support for missing value imputation

Getting started
===============

If you already know about Bayesian statistics:
----------------------------------------------

-  `API quickstart guide <https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/howto/api_quickstart.html>`__
-  The `PyMC tutorial <https://docs.pymc.io/en/latest/learn/core_notebooks/pymc_overview.html>`__
-  `PyMC examples <https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html>`__ and the `API reference <https://docs.pymc.io/en/stable/api.html>`__

Learn Bayesian statistics with a book together with PyMC
--------------------------------------------------------

-  `Bayesian Analysis with Python  <http://bap.com.ar/>`__ (third edition) by Osvaldo Martin: Great introductory book.
-  `Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers>`__: Fantastic book with many applied code examples.
-  `PyMC port of the book "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" by John Kruschke <https://github.com/cluhmann/DBDA-python>`__ as well as the `first edition <https://github.com/aloctavodia/Doing_bayesian_data_analysis>`__.
-  `PyMC port of the book "Statistical Rethinking A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan" by Richard McElreath <https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking>`__
-  `PyMC port of the book "Bayesian Cognitive Modeling" by Michael Lee and EJ Wagenmakers <https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/BCM>`__: Focused on using Bayesian statistics in cognitive modeling.

Audio & Video
-------------

- Here is a `YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Ma_1DBbE82OVW8Fz_6Ts1oOeyOAiovy>`__ gathering several talks on PyMC.
