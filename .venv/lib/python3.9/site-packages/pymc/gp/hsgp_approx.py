class HSGP(Base):
    R"""
    Hilbert Space Gaussian process approximation.

    The `gp.HSGP` class is an implementation of the Hilbert Space Gaussian process.  It is a
    reduced rank GP approximation that uses a fixed set of basis vectors whose coefficients are
    random functions of a stationary covariance function's power spectral density.  Its usage
    is largely similar to `gp.Latent`.  Like `gp.Latent`, it does not assume a Gaussian noise model
    and can be used with any likelihood, or as a component anywhere within a model.  Also like
    `gp.Latent`, it has `prior` and `conditional` methods.  It supports any sum of covariance
    functions that implement a `power_spectral_density` method. (Note, this excludes the
    `Periodic` covariance function, which uses a different set of basis functions for a
    low rank approximation, as described in `HSGPPeriodic`.).

    For information on choosing appropriate `m`, `L`, and `c`, refer to Ruitort-Mayol et al. or to
    the PyMC examples that use HSGP.

    To work with the HSGP in its "linearized" form, as a matrix of basis vectors and a vector of
    coefficients, see the method `prior_linearized`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m: list
        The number of basis vectors to use for each active dimension (covariance parameter
        `active_dim`).
    L: list
        The boundary of the space for each `active_dim`.  It is called the boundary condition.
        Choose L such that the domain `[-L, L]` contains all points in the column of X given by the
        `active_dim`.
    c: float
        The proportion extension factor.  Used to construct L from X.  Defined as `S = max|X|` such
        that `X` is in `[-S, S]`.  `L` is calculated as `c * S`.  One of `c` or `L` must be
        provided.  Further information can be found in Ruitort-Mayol et al.
    drop_first: bool
        Default `False`. Sometimes the first basis vector is quite "flat" and very similar to
        the intercept term.  When there is an intercept in the model, ignoring the first basis
        vector may improve sampling. This argument will be deprecated in future versions.
    parameterization: str
        Whether to use the `centered` or `noncentered` parameterization when multiplying the
        basis by the coefficients.
    cov_func: Covariance function, must be an instance of `Stationary` and implement a
        `power_spectral_density` method.
    mean_func: None, instance of Mean
        The mean function.  Defaults to zero.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code:: python

        # A three dimensional column vector of inputs.
        X = np.random.rand(100, 3)

        with pm.Model() as model:
            # Specify the covariance function.
            # Three input dimensions, but we only want to use the last two.
            cov_func = pm.gp.cov.ExpQuad(3, ls=0.1, active_dims=[1, 2])

            # Specify the HSGP.
            # Use 25 basis vectors across each active dimension for a total of 25 * 25 = 625.
            # The value `c = 4` means the boundary of the approximation
            # lies at four times the half width of the data.
            # In this example the data lie between zero and one,
            # so the boundaries occur at -1.5 and 2.5.  The data, both for
            # training and prediction should reside well within that boundary..
            gp = pm.gp.HSGP(m=[25, 25], c=4.0, cov_func=cov_func)

            # Place a GP prior over the function f.
            f = gp.prior("f", X=X)

        ...

        # After fitting or sampling, specify the distribution
        # at new points with .conditional
        Xnew = np.linspace(-1, 2, 50)[:, None]

        with model:
            fcond = gp.conditional("fcond", Xnew=Xnew)

        """Linearized version of the HSGP.  Returns the Laplace eigenfunctions and the square root
        of the power spectral density needed to create the GP.

        This function allows the user to bypass the GP interface and work with the basis
        and coefficients directly.  This format allows the user to create predictions using
        `pm.set_data` similarly to a linear model.  It also enables computational speed ups in
        multi-GP models, since they may share the same basis.  The return values are the Laplace
        eigenfunctions `phi`, and the square root of the power spectral density.

        Correct results when using `prior_linearized` in tandem with `pm.set_data` and
        `pm.MutableData` require two conditions.  First, one must specify `L` instead of `c` when
        the GP is constructed.  If not, a RuntimeError is raised.  Second, the `Xs` needs to be
        zero-centered, so its mean must be subtracted.  An example is given below.

        ----------
        Xs: array-like

            per row of `Xs` and `prod(m)` columns, one for each basis vector.

class HSGPPeriodic(Base):
    R"""
    Hilbert Space Gaussian process approximation for the Periodic covariance function.

    Note, this is not actually a Hilbert space approximation, but it comes from the same
    paper (Ruitort-Mayol et al., 2022. See Appendix B) and follows the same spirit: using a basis
    approximation to a Gaussian process. In this case, the approximation is based on a series of
    stochastic resonators.

    For these reasons, we have followed the same API as `gp.HSGP`, and can be used as a drop-in
    replacement for `gp.Latent`. Like `gp.Latent`, it has `prior` and `conditional` methods.

    For information on choosing appropriate `m`, refer to Ruitort-Mayol et al.. Note, this approximation
    is only implemented for the 1-D case.

    To work with the approximation in its "linearized" form, as a matrix of basis vectors and a
    vector of coefficients, see the method `prior_linearized`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m: int
        The number of basis vectors to use. Must be a positive integer.
    scale: TensorLike
        The standard deviation (square root of the variance) of the GP effect. Defaults to 1.0.
    cov_func: Must be an instance of instance of `Periodic` covariance
    mean_func: None, instance of Mean
        The mean function.  Defaults to zero.

    Examples
    --------
    .. code:: python

        # A three dimensional column vector of inputs.
        X = np.random.rand(100, 3)

        with pm.Model() as model:

    def prior_linearized(self, Xs: TensorLike):
        """Linearized version of the approximation. Returns the cosine and sine bases and coefficients
        of the expansion needed to create the GP.

        This function allows the user to bypass the GP interface and work directly with the basis
        and coefficients directly.  This format allows the user to create predictions using
        `pm.set_data` similarly to a linear model.  It also enables computational speed ups in
        multi-GP models since they may share the same basis.

        Correct results when using `prior_linearized` in tandem with `pm.set_data` and
        `pm.MutableData` require that the `Xs` are zero-centered, so it's mean must be subtracted.
        An example is given below.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Xs: array-like
            Function input values.  Assumes they have been mean subtracted or centered at zero.

        Returns
        -------
        (phi_cos, phi_sin): Tuple[array-like]
            List of either Numpy or PyTensor 2D array of the cosine and sine fixed basis vectors.
            There are n rows, one per row of `Xs` and `m` columns, one for each basis vector.
        psd: array-like
            Either a Numpy or PyTensor 1D array of the coefficients of the expansion.

        Examples
        --------
