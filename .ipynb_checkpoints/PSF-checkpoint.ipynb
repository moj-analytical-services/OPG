    "# Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) algorithm\n",
    "Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting (PSF) takes univariate time series data as input and assist to forecast its future values. This algorithm forecasts the behavior of time series based on similarity of pattern sequences. Initially, clustering is done with the labeling of samples from database. The labels associated with samples are then used for forecasting the future behaviour of time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Algorithm Pattern Sequence based Forecasting (PSF) was first proposed by Martinez Alvarez, et al., 2008 and then modified and suggested improvement by Martinez Alvarez, et al., 2011. The technical detailes are mentioned in referenced articles. PSF algorithm consists of various statistical operations like:\n",
