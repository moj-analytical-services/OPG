# OPG Forecasting Models
This repo is created by Leila Yousefi@MoJ to provide documentation and scripts used in forecasting models for the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).


## What is this project for?
1. **Short Term LPA Forecast**: 
    projections of 12 months or less of LPA applications received and numbers registered as a month profile. Frequency (to be agreed). Supports long term forecast.

2. **Long Term LPA Forecast**: 
    It is necessary to forecast LPA income, and forecast trends in deputyships an investigations. Long term projections (5 years +). Annual numbers of LPA applications received and registered with uncertainty ranges. Frequency: Annual updates. 

3. **Long Term Deputyships Forecast**: 
    necessary to forecast income from cases under active supervision, changes in the age structure of supervised cases and impact on remissions and exemptions; necessary to forecast investigations arising from deputyships. Long term projections (5 years +). Annual numbers of new deputyship cases, and numbers of cases under active supervision. Frequency: annual updates.  

4. **Long Term Investigations Forecast**: 
    necessary to understand resource demands (and costs) of expected increasing numbers of investigations from the rapidly rising numbers of existing LPA holders. Long term projections (5 years +) . Numbers pf projections split by origin LPAs, Deputyships , EPA and others.


## Bussiness Need:
These demand forecasts are crucial for several reasons:
- **Setting OPG Fees**: They inform fee structures, impacting the financial viability of the OPG.
- **Staffing Decisions**: They guide decisions on staffing levels and deployment, especially for specialist casework roles.
- **Resource Allocation**: They play a role in both short-term resource allocation and long-term strategic planning.


## Overview of OPG projects
The current spreadsheet models in question generate long-term forecasts (spanning from 2023 to 2029) for three critical areas of demand within OPG:
1. **Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs)**: These legal documents allow individuals to appoint someone they trust (an attorney) to make decisions on their behalf if they become unable to do so themselves. LPAs are essential for decision-making related to financial matters, health, and welfare.
   - **Definition**: LPAs are legal documents where an individual (the donor) nominates someone (the attorney) to make decisions on their behalf if they lose mental capacity.
   - **Creation**: LPAs are set up while the donor still has mental capacity.
   - **Types**: There are two types of LPAs: one for financial decisions and another for health and care decisions.
   - **Flexibility**: LPAs offer flexibility, allowing individuals to choose and trust their attorneys.
   
2. **Deputyships**: Deputyships come into play when individuals lack an LPA or an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA). A deputy is appointed by the Court of Protection to make decisions for someone who lacks mental capacity.
   - **Definition**: Deputyship is a legal mechanism where the Court of Protection appoints an individual (the deputy) to make specific decisions on behalf of someone who lacks mental capacity.
   - **Purpose**: Deputies act in the best interests of the person who has lost capacity. They handle financial, health, and welfare matters.
   - **Process**: The court oversees deputyship appointments, ensuring compliance with legal requirements.
   - **Timing**: Deputyship occurs after the person has lost mental capacity.
   - **Supervision**: Deputies submit annual reports to the OPG, and the court reviews their decisions regularly.
   
3. **Investigations**: The number of investigations conducted by the OPG depends on factors like the population of living LPA holders and the active deputyship caseload. These investigations ensure that attorneys and deputies act in the best interests of the person they represent.
   - **Definition**: OPG investigations focus on allegations of abuse or misconduct related to attorneys or deputies acting under registered LPAs or court orders.
   - **Role**: The Public Guardian investigates concerns raised by individuals or third parties.
   - **Criteria**: Investigations occur when there are grounds to suggest that the person at risk is not being adequately protected or their best interests are not met.
   - **Assessment**: The OPG assesses the individual's mental capacity during investigations to ensure empowerment and compliance with the Mental Capacity Act.
   - **Proportionality**: Investigations are proportionate and decided case-by-case.

In summary, LPAs allow individuals to proactively nominate trusted attorneys, while deputyship involves court oversight and occurs after mental capacity is lost. Investigations address concerns related to abuse or misconduct by attorneys or deputies. Each serves a distinct purpose within the OPG's safeguarding framework¹²³.


### LPA vs. Deputyship
The **Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)** and **Deputyship** serve similar purposes—they both allow someone to act on your behalf when you lack mental capacity. However, they differ in several crucial ways:
1. **Mental Capacity and Timing**:
   - **LPA**: You create an LPA while you still have mental capacity. You nominate someone (an attorney) to act on your behalf for financial, health, or welfare decisions.
   - **Deputyship**: The Court of Protection appoints a deputy for you after you've lost mental capacity. The proposed deputy applies to the court on your behalf.

2. **Process Length**:
   - **LPA**: You can arrange, write, and register an LPA in about 8 to 12 weeks. Once registered, your attorneys can act immediately.
   - **Deputyship**: The court application for deputyship can take 4 to 6 months. During this waiting period, no one can make decisions on your behalf or access your funds.

3. **Costs**:
   - **LPA**: Nominating an attorney under an LPA is cheaper. Registering an individual LPA costs £82.
   - **Deputyship**: The court fee for a single deputyship application is £365. Deputyships also incur annual supervision fees.

4. **Supervision and Reporting**:
   - **LPA**: Attorneys do not need to report to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). The assumption is that they act in your best interests.
   - **Deputyship**: Court-appointed deputies face greater supervision. They submit annual reports to the OPG, accounting for their expenditure. The court reviews their decisions yearly.

In summary, an LPA offers more flexibility, is quicker to implement, and allows you to choose trusted individuals. Deputyship involves court oversight, is more complex, and occurs after you've lost mental capacity.
