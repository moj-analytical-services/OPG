# Incorporating demand intelligence tools, data science models, and machine learning techniques into the long-term and short-term forecasting for Living Power of Attorney (LPA) demands can significantly enhance your understanding of demand patterns. 

*Which machine learning techniques can be used to incorporate the impact of covid period demands (e.g., mortality rate, population projection, number of LPA applications) and uncertainty around the data in long-term and short-term forecasting of LPA demands to provide accurate forecats for the LPA demands?

*how to Utilise demand intelligence tools and data science models to incorporate real-time data and predictive analytics into forecasts, to help in understanding the impact of covid period on demand (Living Power of Authorney (LPA) applications in Office of Public Guardian (OPG)) in long-term forecasting model (e.g.,cohort-based model) and short-term (e.g., exponential smoothing). 

# External Factors: 
How to incorporate external factors to deal with covid-period effects on the outcome into a LPA demands long-term forecating model using cohort model in excel as well as LPA demands short-term forecating model using exponentional smoothing model in excel?
- Consider external factors that could influence demand, such as changes in legislation, economic conditions, and societal trends. 
- The Powers of Attorney Act 2023, for example, aims to digitise the LPA process, which could affect demand patterns.
- **Incorporating external factors into the forecasting model is a multi-step process that enhances the model’s accuracy and robustness.**
- By following the following steps, you can create a forecasting model that not only reflects historical trends but also adapts to the dynamic nature of external influences, providing a more accurate forecast for LPA demands: 

- Identify Relevant Factors: 
    - Determine which external factors are likely to influence the demand for LPA applications. 
    - This could include economic indicators, demographic trends, policy changes, and health advisories.

- Data Collection: 
    - Gather data on these factors over a period that aligns with your historical demand data. 
    - This will help in establishing correlations.

- Feature Engineering: 
    - Transform these external factors into features that your model can interpret. 
    - For example, you can create binary flags for events (like a pandemic onset) or continuous variables for economic indicators.

- Model Integration: 
    - Use statistical models like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) or advanced techniques like machine learning algorithms to integrate these features into your forecasting model. 
    - This could involve adding the features as additional variables in your dataset.

- Scenario Analysis: 
    - Develop scenarios based on different combinations and intensities of external factors to see how they would impact demand.

- Model Training: 
    - Train your model using the historical data along with the new external features. This will allow the model to learn the relationship between these factors and LPA demand.

- Validation and Testing: 
    - Validate your model against a separate dataset to ensure it accurately predicts demand considering the external factors.

- Continuous Improvement: 
    - Regularly update your model with new data and review the external factors to ensure they remain relevant and accurately represented in the model.

- Monitor Real-Time Data: 
    - Use real-time data to adjust your forecasts promptly. This helps in responding quickly to sudden changes in external conditions3.

# Bayesian (probabilistic) models
- Incorporating uncertainly friendly models in Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) forecasting can enhance accuracy and provide a probabilistic framework for handling uncertainty. 
- Applying uncertainty around volatile data (application demands) affected by COVID pandemic in log-term time series forecasting model.

## Understanding Bayesian Models:
- Bayesian models are based on Bayes’ theorem, which updates our beliefs (probabilities) based on new evidence.
- These models incorporate prior knowledge (prior distribution) and update it with observed data to obtain a posterior distribution.
- In the context of LPA forecasting, Bayesian models allow us to quantify uncertainty and make informed predictions.

## Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs):
- DLMs are a class of Bayesian state space models commonly used for time series forecasting.
- DLMs can handle time-varying parameters, seasonality, and irregularities in data.
- DLMs consist of two components:
    - State Equation: Describes how the underlying state (e.g., capacity fluctuations) evolves over time.
    - Observation Equation: Relates the observed data (e.g., LPA applications) to the underlying state.


## Steps to Incorporate Bayesian Models:

## Prior Specification:
- Define prior distributions for model parameters (e.g., capacity loss rates, trend coefficients).
- Priors can be informative (based on domain knowledge) or non-informative (flat priors).

## Likelihood Function:
- Specify the likelihood function that relates observed data to the model parameters.
- For LPA forecasting, this could be based on historical LPA application data.

## Posterior Inference:
- Use Bayes’ theorem to update the prior distribution based on observed data.
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or variational inference can estimate the posterior distribution.

## Prediction:
- Simulate from the posterior distribution to obtain predictive samples.
- These samples represent possible future scenarios, accounting for uncertainty.


## Model Selection: Choose an appropriate DLM structure:
Local Level Model: Represents a random walk (e.g., gradual capacity decline).
Local Linear Trend Model: Includes both level and slope components.
Seasonal Models: Capture seasonal patterns.
Regression Models: Incorporate external predictors (e.g., health indicators).
Model selection can be guided by cross-validation or information criteria (e.g., Bayesian Information Criterion).

## Updating Over Time:
As new LPA application data becomes available, update the model using Bayesian methods.
This allows the model to adapt to changing conditions (e.g., shifts in capacity fluctuations).

## Scenario Analysis:
Generate probabilistic forecasts for different scenarios:
Gradual capacity decline.
Sudden capacity loss due to health events.
Capacity improvement (if relevant).
Assess the impact of these scenarios on LPA applications.
Remember that Bayesian models provide a flexible framework for incorporating prior knowledge, handling uncertainty, and adapting to changing conditions. While implementing Bayesian models in Excel directly may be challenging, consider using specialized statistical software (e.g., Python with libraries like pymc3 or Stan) for more complex modeling12. 


## Bayesian models Limitation:
While Bayesian models offer several advantages, they also come with limitations, especially when applied to LPA forecasting as followings:
- Computational Complexity:
    - Bayesian models involve complex calculations, especially when estimating posterior distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
    - For large datasets or high-dimensional models, the computational burden can be significant.

- Subjectivity in Prior Selection:
    - Bayesian models require specifying prior distributions for model parameters.
    - The choice of priors can impact the results, and different analysts may choose different priors based on their beliefs or domain knowledge.
    - Subjective priors can introduce bias if not carefully considered.

- Data Requirements:
    - Bayesian models perform well when sufficient data is available.
    - Sparse or noisy data can lead to unreliable posterior estimates.
    - In the case of LPAs, historical data may be limited, especially for specific subgroups (e.g., rare health conditions).

- Model Misspecification:
    - If the chosen Bayesian model does not accurately represent the underlying process (e.g., capacity fluctuations), the results may be misleading.
    - Model misspecification can lead to biased parameter estimates.

- Assumptions of Independence:
    - Many Bayesian models assume independence between observations.
    - In reality, dependencies may exist (e.g., correlations between LPAs within the same family).
    - Ignoring dependencies can affect the accuracy of forecasts.

- Interpretability:
    - Bayesian models provide posterior distributions, which are more informative than point estimates.
    - However, interpreting complex posterior distributions can be challenging for non-experts.
    - Communicating uncertainty effectively to stakeholders may require additional effort.

- Limited Excel Integration:
    - Implementing Bayesian models directly in Excel can be cumbersome due to its limitations in handling probabilistic calculations.
    - Specialised statistical software (e.g., Python, R) is better suited for Bayesian modeling.

- Assumption of Stationarity:
    - Some Bayesian time series models assume stationarity (constant statistical properties over time).
    - In practice, capacity fluctuations may exhibit non-stationary behaviour (e.g., trends, seasonality).

- Model Complexity vs. Parsimony:
    - Bayesian models can become overly complex if too many parameters are included.
    - Balancing model complexity with parsimony is essential to avoid overfitting.

- Updating Models Over Time:
    - Incorporating new data into Bayesian models requires re-estimating posterior distributions.
    - Real-time updates can be computationally intensive.
    - Despite these limitations, Bayesian models remain valuable tools for handling uncertainty, incorporating prior knowledge, and making informed predictions. 



## Addressing model misspecification in Bayesian LPA forecasting?
- What are the alternatives to MCMC for estimating posterior distributions?
- Can you explain how to perform sensitivity analysis on priors in a Bayesian model?
- What are the legal implications of capacity fluctuations in LPAs?
- Can you provide an example of a sensitivity analysis for LPA applications?**


- Model Misspecification in Bayesian LPA Forecasting:
Model misspecification occurs when the chosen Bayesian model does not accurately represent the underlying process (e.g., capacity fluctuations).To address this:

- Prior Sensitivity Analysis: 
Explore different prior distributions for model parameters. Assess how changes in priors impact the posterior distribution and predictions.

- Alternative Models: 
Consider alternative Bayesian models (e.g., different likelihood functions, non-parametric models) and compare their performance.

- Gaussian-Process Approximations: 
Use Gaussian-process approximations to improve posterior estimates12.

## Alternatives to MCMC for Estimating Posterior Distributions:
- While MCMC is widely used, other methods exist:
    - Variational Inference: Solves an optimization problem to approximate the posterior faster than simple MCMC.
    - Importance Sampling: Estimates properties of posteriors by sampling from an approximation.
    - Analytical Solutions: In some cases, posterior distributions can be computed analytically34.

- Performing Sensitivity Analysis on Priors in a Bayesian Model:
Sensitivity analysis assesses how changes in priors affect model outcomes.

### Steps:
- Define a range of prior values (e.g., mean, variance).
- Run the model with different priors.
- Observe how posterior distributions and predictions vary.
- Compare estimated parameters and make conclusions based on context5.
- Legal Implications of Capacity Fluctuations in LPAs:
- LPAs grant decision-making authority to attorneys when the donor lacks capacity.
- Legal implications:
- Freezing of Accounts: Without an LPA, banks may freeze accounts if a signatory lacks capacity.
- Deputyship Applications: If no LPA exists, a third party can apply to be appointed as a deputy by the Court of Protection.
- Business LPAs: For business accounts, lacking an LPA can impact financial operations678.
- Example of Sensitivity Analysis for LPA Applications:
- Suppose we have an LPA model with priors for mean1 and mean2 (related to capacity).
- Vary the priors (e.g., mean1, tau1, tau2) within reasonable ranges.
- Observe how estimated parameters (e.g., A, mean1) change.
- Conclude based on the impact of different priors on LPA decisions5.
- Remember that sensitivity analysis helps assess the robustness of Bayesian models and informs decision-making. 




## Handling missing data in Bayesian models is essential for accurate inference.
### Conceptual Understanding of Missing Data:
Missing data can arise due to various reasons, such as design issues or factors beyond researchers’ control.
We’ll focus on a hypothetical regression problem where we predict voting intention (YY) using people’s age (XX).

### Types of Missing Data Mechanisms:

#### MCAR (Missing Completely at Random):
Missingness is unrelated to any research question.
Example: Interviewer accidentally erases responses (unrelated to age or voting intention).
Under MCAR, using cases with no missing values provides valid inferences and unbiased estimations.

#### MAR (Missing at Random):
Missingness depends on observed variables (e.g., XX) but not the unobserved outcome (YY).
Example: Older people more likely to give a missing response (related to XX).

#### NMAR (Not Missing at Random):
Missingness depends on unobserved factors (e.g., ZZ) related to neither XX nor YY.
Example: People with lower voting intention less likely to respond (related to YY itself).

#### Bayesian Approaches to Handle Missing Data:

##### Treat Missing Data as Parameters:
Assign priors to missing values (kid_score in our example).
Estimate their posterior distributions.
Incorporate all available information in the analysis.

##### Multiple Imputation:
Generate multiple imputed datasets by imputing missing values.
Analyze each dataset separately and combine results.

##### Bayesian origin: 
Impute missing values using predictive distributions.

##### Checking for MCAR:
Compare the distribution of XX for cases with and without missing data on YY.
If means and variances of XX are similar, it suggests MCAR.
Regression lines remain stable with or without missing data.
Remember that Bayesian models allow us to treat missing data as parameters, leveraging all available information. Multiple imputation is another powerful technique to handle missingness. Choose the approach based on the specific context and assumptions about missing data12. 



### Multiple imputation (MI) technique for handling missing data
Multiple imputation (MI) is a powerful technique for handling missing data, and incorporating it into a Bayesian framework provides a robust and flexible approach. 

#### Conceptual Understanding of Missing Data:
Missing data can arise due to various reasons, such as design issues or factors beyond researchers’ control.
In Bayesian modeling, we treat missing values as unknown parameters and estimate their posterior distributions.

#### Types of Missing Data Mechanisms:
There are three main types of missing data mechanisms:
MCAR (Missing Completely at Random): Missingness unrelated to any research question.
MAR (Missing at Random): Missingness depends on observed variables but not the unobserved outcome.
NMAR (Not Missing at Random): Missingness depends on unobserved factors unrelated to observed variables.

#### Bayesian Approach to Handling Missing Data:
Treat Missing Data as Parameters:
In Bayesian models, we incorporate missing data directly into the model.
Missing values become parameters with prior distributions.
The posterior distribution accounts for both observed and missing data.
This approach leverages all available information and avoids discarding cases with missing values.

#### Multiple Imputation (MI):
MI generates multiple synthetic datasets by imputing missing values.
Each dataset represents a plausible completion of the missing data.

#### Bayesian MI involves the following steps:
Impute Missing Values: Impute missing data using predictive distributions (e.g., regression models).
Analyze Each Imputed Dataset Separately: Perform Bayesian analysis on each imputed dataset.
Combine Results: Combine parameter estimates, credible intervals, and other inferences across multiple imputed datasets.

#### Account for Uncertainty: 
The variability across imputed datasets reflects the uncertainty due to missing data.

#### Benefits of Bayesian MI:
Incorporates Uncertainty: Bayesian methods naturally propagate uncertainty.
Integrates Prior Information: Prior distributions provide additional context.
Flexible and Robust: Handles different missing data mechanisms.
Valid Inferences: Provides valid parameter estimates and credible intervals.

#### Example Application:
Suppose we have a regression model predicting voting intention (YY) based on age (XX).
Impute missing YY values using Bayesian regression models.
Analyze each imputed dataset separately (e.g., compute posterior distributions for regression coefficients).
Combine results across imputed datasets to obtain overall parameter estimates.
Remember that Bayesian MI allows us to handle missing data while maintaining the richness of uncertainty. It’s a powerful tool for robust statistical inference.


### Bayesian multiple imputation is a powerful technique for handling missing data, but it relies on certain assumptions.
#### Missing at Random (MAR):
The MAR assumption is crucial for multiple imputation.
It implies that the probability of missingness depends only on observed variables (not the unobserved outcome) after accounting for other observed variables.
In other words, missingness is related to the available information in the dataset.
If data are MAR, imputing missing values based on observed variables can lead to unbiased parameter estimates.

#### Predictive Model Assumption:
Bayesian multiple imputation imputes missing values using predictive models.
The assumption is that the predictive model accurately captures the relationship between observed and missing data.
If the model is misspecified, imputed values may be biased.

#### Assumption of Ignorable Missingness Mechanism:
Ignorable missingness means that the missing data mechanism does not introduce systematic bias.
If data are MCAR or MAR, the missingness mechanism is considered ignorable.
Ignorable missingness allows valid inferences using multiple imputation.

#### Appropriate Choice of Imputation Model:
Selecting an appropriate predictive model for imputation is essential.
The model should reflect the underlying data-generating process.
Consider linear regression, logistic regression, or other relevant models.

#### Sufficient Number of Imputations:
Multiple imputation generates several imputed datasets.
The number of imputations affects the precision of estimates.
More imputations reduce uncertainty due to missing data.

#### Assumption of Exchangeability:
Exchangeability assumes that the imputed datasets are exchangeable (i.e., interchangeable).
This allows combining results across imputed datasets.
In practice, exchangeability is often reasonable.

#### Sensitivity to Prior Distributions:
Bayesian imputation involves specifying prior distributions for model parameters.
Sensitivity analysis explores how different priors impact results.
Robustness to prior choices is desirable.
Remember that while Bayesian multiple imputation is a powerful tool, understanding and validating these assumptions are critical for reliable results

# LSTM
**How to use LSTM method for the LPA demands short-term and long-term forecasting model to deal with covid-period effects on the outcome and deal with uncertatinty?**

*Using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) method for forecasting LPA demands can be particularly effective for capturing complex patterns and dealing with uncertainties, 
such as those introduced during the COVID-period. 

**Applying LSTM for both short-term and long-term forecasting:

- Data Preparation: 
Organise LPA demand data into a sequence that can be used for training the LSTM model. This includes normalising the data and possibly transforming it into a supervised learning problem.

- Feature Selection: 
Choose relevant features that could influence LPA demands, including historical demand data, COVID-period indicators, and possibly external factors like economic indicators or policy changes.

- Model Architecture: 
Design your LSTM network architecture. This typically involves defining the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the connections between the layers.

- Incorporate COVID-period Effects: 
Integrate COVID-period effects by including them as input features or by creating a separate model that specifically predicts the impact of COVID-related variables on LPA demands.

- Train the Model: 
Use historical data to train your LSTM model. This involves feeding the input features into the network and adjusting the weights through backpropagation based on the error between the predicted and actual values.

- Validation: 
Validate your model using a separate dataset to ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

- Uncertainty Handling: 
To deal with uncertainty, use techniques like Monte Carlo simulations or Bayesian methods to get a distribution of possible outcomes rather than a single point estimate.

- Forecasting: 
Use the trained LSTM model to forecast future LPA demands. 
    - For short-term forecasting, might use a smaller window of historical data,
    - while for long-term forecasting, would use a larger window to capture more trends and cycles.

- Model Updating: 
Regularly update your model with new data to capture the latest trends and improve the accuracy of your forecasts.

- Interpretation: 
- Interpret the model’s outputs carefully, considering the confidence intervals or prediction intervals to understand the range of possible future scenarios.
- **LSTM models are powerful because they can capture long-term dependencies and are capable of learning patterns in time series data, which is essential when dealing with the irregularities and uncertainties of the COVID-period123. 
- To monitor the performance of your LSTM model and be prepared to adjust the architecture or retrain the model as more data becomes available or as the situation evolves.

**How to choose the right architecture for my LSTM model?
- Choosing the right architecture for your LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is essential for effective time series forecasting. 
- Select the appropriate architecture for your LPA demands forecasting model:

- Define Your Problem: 
Understand the specifics of your forecasting task, including the nature of the LPA demand data, the impact of the COVID-period, and the level of uncertainty.

- Data Preprocessing: 
Prepare your data by normalising or standardizing it, and structure it into sequences that are suitable for LSTM.

- Determine Sequence Length: 
The length of the input sequences should capture the relevant temporal dependencies. For LPA demands, consider the typical cycles and seasonality.

- Select Number of Layers: 
Start with one or two LSTM layers. Deep LSTMs, with more layers, can model more complex patterns but may also require more data and training time.

- Choose Number of Neurons: 
The number of neurons in each layer should reflect the complexity of the problem. More neurons can capture more information but can also lead to overfitting.

- Decide on Dropout: 
Implement dropout to prevent overfitting, especially if you have a lot of data or a complex model.

- Batch Size and Epochs: 
Choose a batch size and number of epochs that balance the speed of learning with the stability of the convergence.
Optimization and Loss Functions: Select an optimizer like Adam or RMSprop, which are generally good choices for LSTMs. 
Use a loss function that matches your specific forecasting objective, such as mean squared error for regression tasks.

- Regularisation: 
Apply L1 or L2 regularization if you’re dealing with overfitting.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: 
Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to systematically explore different model architectures.

- Validation Strategy: 
Use a hold-out validation set or k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different architectures.

- Model Evaluation: 
Assess the model using appropriate metrics for forecasting, such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

- Iterative Refinement: 
It’s often an iterative process. You may need to adjust the architecture based on the performance of the model and refine it until you achieve satisfactory results.
There’s no one-size-fits-all architecture for LSTM models. It’s a process of experimentation and refinement to find the architecture that works best for your specific dataset and forecasting needs123. 
Be prepared to iterate and possibly combine different approaches to handle the complexities introduced by the COVID-period effects.

# Short-Term Forecasting Using an Exponential Smoothing Model in Excel

#### Time Series Data: 
Organise LPA demand data in a time series format suitable for exponential smoothing.

#### External Factor Adjustment: 
Integrate external factors by adjusting the smoothing factor or by adding a correction term to the forecast equation based on the impact of these factors2.

#### Forecasting: 
Apply the exponential smoothing formula to forecast short-term demand. The formula in Excel would look something like this:Forecast=α×Actual+(1−α)×Previous Forecast

#### Model Validation: 
Compare your forecasts against actual data to validate the model and adjust as necessary.

*Note: the key to successful forecasting is not only in the technical application of these models but also in the continuous refinement and adjustment based on new data and changing external conditions. 
Regularly update your models to incorporate the latest data and external factors to maintain accuracy in your forecasts.

#### Smoothing Factor: 
Determine the smoothing factor (α) that gives more weight to recent observations.

*How do I choose the right smoothing factor (α)?
Choosing the right smoothing factor (α) for exponential smoothing is crucial as it determines how much weight is given to recent observations in the forecasting model.

**Guidelines to help you select an appropriate α:**

##### Understand the Range: 
The smoothing factor α ranges from 0 to 1. A value close to 1 gives more weight to recent observations, making the forecast more responsive to changes. 
Conversely, a value close to 0 makes the forecast more stable and less sensitive to recent fluctuations1.

##### Historical Data Analysis: Look at your historical data. If the data shows that recent trends are a good predictor of future values, 
consider a higher α. If the data is more random or if older values are also important, consider a lower α2.

##### Error Measurement: 
Use error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts with different α values. 
The α that minimizes the error is typically the best choice3.

##### Trial and Error: 
Start with a value of α, such as 0.5, and adjust it incrementally. Observe how these adjustments affect the forecast accuracy and adjust accordingly4.

##### Model Validation: 
Validate your chosen α by comparing the model’s forecasts against actual outcomes. Adjust the α if the model’s performance can be improved1.

##### Consider External Factors: 
If your model needs to respond quickly to external shocks, such as those caused by the COVID-period, a higher α might be necessary. 
However, be cautious as a high α can also make the model react to random noise2.

##### Use Optimization Techniques: 
Some software packages can automatically optimize α based on historical data. 
In Excel, need to manually test different α values or use Solver to find the optimal value1.
Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all value for α, and it may need to be adjusted over time as the characteristics of the data change. 
It’s important to regularly review and potentially update the smoothing factor to ensure your forecasts remain accurate.

# Which alternative method works the best for the LPA demands forecasting model to deal with covid-period effects on the outcome?

When considering alternative methods for forecasting LPA demands, especially in the context of the COVID-period effects, 
it’s important to choose a method that can adapt to rapid changes and incorporate various external factors. 

*Note: Each of the following methods has its strengths and can be chosen based on the specific needs of your forecasting model, the availability of data, and the level of complexity you’re willing to manage. It’s also beneficial to combine different methods to create a hybrid model that leverages the advantages of each approach.

## Consumer Sentiment Models: 
Incorporating consumer sentiment into models can be particularly effective. This involves using qualitative data on consumer behavior and attitudes, 
which can be critical during unpredictable periods like the COVID-19 pandemic1.
* ref: https://hbr.org/2020/11/a-better-model-for-economic-forecasting-during-the-pandemic
Scenario Analysis: Create scenarios based on different sentiment trends to understand how extreme changes in consumer sentiment could affect LPA demand.

## SPRINT Re-plan Approach: 
McKinsey suggests a SPRINT re-plan approach for rapidly forecasting demand during crises. 
This involves tracking shifts in consumer behavior across several dimensions and adjusting commercial strategies accordingly2.
* ref: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/rapidly-forecasting-demand-and-adapting-commercial-plans-in-a-pandemic

## Adaptive Short-Term Models: 
For short-term forecasting, adaptive methods like Generalized Additive Models (GAM) or machine learning algorithms can be useful. 
These models can adjust quickly to new data and are capable of handling non-linear relationships4.

## Simple Models with Lift Adjustment:
In times of disruption, simple models like lift-adjusted seasonal naive methods are recommended. 
These models measure change from the baseline at higher levels of hierarchy and then propagate this lift to lower levels5.

## Enhanced Long-Term Models: 
For long-term forecasting, models that capture the physics of transmission, project human behavioral reactions, 
and reset state variables to account for randomness have been found to correlate with better predictions3.

**How do I incorporate Enhanced Long-Term Models into my cohort forecasting model?**
Incorporating Enhanced Long-Term Models into your cohort forecasting model involves integrating features that have been identified as beneficial for long-term prediction accuracy.
By incorporating these features into your cohort forecasting model, you can enhance its long-term predictive power and 
make it more responsive to the complexities introduced by the COVID-period effects and other external factors.

* ref: https://towardsdatascience.com/forecasting-with-cohort-based-models-e71003bc7ecd

### Capture the Physics of Transmission: 
Incorporate mechanisms that reflect the actual process of LPA application and approval.
This could involve understanding and modeling the flow of applications through different stages and the factors that influence transition rates at each stage1.

### Project Human Behavioral Reactions:
Include variables that account for how people’s behaviors might change over time in response to external events, such as policy changes or public health crises.
This can be done by analyzing past behaviors in similar situations or by conducting surveys1.

### Reset State Variables: 
Before making long-term projections, reset the state variables in your model to account for randomness and uncertainty not captured in the model. 
This might involve re-evaluating initial conditions or incorporating stochastic elements into the model1.

### Data Transformation: 
Reformat your time series data into tabular data that aligns with cohorts based on registration or application dates. 
This allows you to apply regression models that can offer additional insights regarding the attribution of future LPA demands to specific cohorts2.

### Model Enhancement: 
Consider using lightweight models enhanced with hierarchical decomposition, which can provide precise forecasting with fewer computations and parameters. 
This approach can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or complex systems3.

### Behavioral Feedbacks: 
Integrate endogenous behavioral responses into your model. 
This means that the model should allow for the perceived risk or awareness of LPAs to continuously change the demand through the adoption and relaxation of various behaviors1.

**How do I incorporate Behavioral Feedbacks into my cohort forecasting model?**
Incorporating enhanced behavioral feedbacks into your cohort forecasting model involves integrating behavioral dynamics that can influence the demand for LPAs. 
By following these steps, you can enhance your cohort forecasting model to more accurately reflect the dynamic nature of human behavior and its impact on LPA demand.

#### Behavioral Data Collection: 
Gather data on behaviors that are likely to impact LPA demand, such as changes in legal advice seeking, public awareness of LPAs, and shifts in health-related behaviors due to COVID-19.

#### Quantify Behaviors: 
Convert qualitative behavioral data into quantitative metrics. 
For example, use survey data to create indices representing the level of public awareness or concern about health issues.

#### Cohort Segmentation: 
Segment your cohorts based on behavioral characteristics. This could mean creating sub-cohorts within your data that reflect different behavioral responses.

#### Modeling Behavioral Trends: 
Use regression analysis or other statistical methods to model how these behaviors have impacted LPA demand historically. 
This will help you understand the relationship between behavior and demand1.

#### Incorporate Feedback Loops: 
Create feedback loops in your model where the demand for LPAs influences future behaviors, which in turn affect future demand. 
This can be done by setting up equations or algorithms that simulate this interaction.

#### Adjust for COVID-19 Effects: 
Specifically adjust your behavioral feedbacks to account for the unique impacts of the COVID-19 period. 
This may involve analyzing how behaviors changed during the pandemic and integrating this into your model.

#### Scenario Analysis: 
Run scenario analyses to see how different behavioral responses could impact LPA demand. 
This helps in understanding the potential range of outcomes and preparing for various possibilities.

#### Continuous Updating: 
Keep your model updated with the latest behavioral data to ensure that the feedbacks remain relevant and accurate.

#### Validation and Testing: 
Regularly validate and test your model against actual data to ensure that the behavioral feedbacks are correctly influencing the forecast.

# SARIMA
**How to use SARIMA method for the LPA demands short-term and long-term forecasting model to deal with covid-period effects on the outcome and deal with uncertatinty?

The SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) method is a powerful tool for forecasting time series data that exhibits seasonal patterns. 
It’s particularly useful for dealing with uncertainties like those introduced during the COVID-period. 
By following these steps, you can create a robust SARIMA forecasting model that accounts for both seasonal patterns and the uncertain effects of the COVID-period on LPA demand outcomes. 
The key to effective forecasting is not only in the initial model development but also in ongoing model refinement and adaptation to new data.

**Using SARIMA for both short-term and long-term forecasting of LPA demands:**
Understand SARIMA: 
SARIMA extends the ARIMA model by including seasonal terms. It is represented as SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s), where:
( p, d, q ) are the non-seasonal orders for autoregression, differencing, and moving average, respectively.
( P, D, Q ) are the seasonal orders for autoregression, differencing, and moving average.
( s ) is the number of periods in a season1.

#### Data Preparation: 
Organize your LPA demand data into a time series format. Include a timestamp for each data point to identify seasonal patterns.

#### Stationarity Check: 
Ensure your data is stationary, meaning its statistical properties do not change over time. Use differencing to stabilize the mean if necessary.

#### Identify Seasonality: 
Determine the seasonality in your data (e.g., monthly, quarterly) and use seasonal differencing if required to remove seasonal trends and achieve stationarity.

#### Model Selection: 
Choose the SARIMA model parameters (p, d, q, P, D, Q, s) based on your data’s autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. You may need to experiment with different combinations to find the best fit.

#### Incorporate COVID-period Effects: 
To account for the COVID-period effects, you can include dummy variables representing pre-COVID, during-COVID, and post-COVID periods or use external regressors that capture related impacts.

#### Uncertainty Handling: 
Use the confidence intervals provided by the SARIMA model to understand the range of possible outcomes. This helps in dealing with uncertainty in your forecasts.

#### Model Fitting: 
Fit the SARIMA model to your historical LPA demand data, including any COVID-period effects you’ve identified.

#### Validation: 
Validate your model by comparing its forecasts against actual data. Adjust the model parameters if necessary to improve accuracy.

#### Forecasting: 
Once validated, use the SARIMA model to forecast short-term and long-term LPA demands. The model will provide a point forecast along with confidence intervals for each predicted value.

#### Update Regularly: 
Continuously update your model with new data to refine the forecasts and adjust for any changes in trends or seasonal patterns.

### **How do I choose the right SARIMA parameters?**
Choosing the right parameters for a SARIMA model is a critical step in time series forecasting. , the goal is to find a parsimonious model 
that adequately captures the patterns in the data without overfitting. It’s a balance between model complexity and forecast accuracy123.
Here’s a structured approach to selecting the appropriate parameters:

#### Seasonal Identification: 
Determine if your data exhibits a strong seasonal pattern and identify the length of the season (s). This could be based on domain knowledge or exploratory data analysis.

#### Stationarity Check: 
Ensure that your time series is stationary, as SARIMA requires this. You may need to apply differencing to achieve stationarity.

#### ACF and PACF Analysis: 
Use Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to get initial estimates of the parameters. The ACF shows the correlation of the time series with its own lagged values, while the PACF shows the partial correlation of the time series with its own lagged values, controlling for the values of the time series at all shorter lags.

#### Parameter Estimation:
Non-seasonal parameters (p, d, q): Look for the lag after which the PACF cuts off for the AR parameter (p), and the lag after which the ACF tails off for the MA parameter (q). The differencing parameter (d) is determined based on the number of differences required to achieve stationarity.
Seasonal parameters (P, D, Q): Similar to the non-seasonal parameters, but you look at the seasonal lags in the ACF and PACF plots. For example, if your data has a seasonal period of 12, you would look at lags 12, 24, 36, etc.

#### Model Fitting: 
Fit the SARIMA model with the chosen parameters and evaluate its performance. Look at the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) values to compare different models.

#### Grid Search: 
Perform a grid search over a range of parameter values to find the optimal combination that minimizes the AIC or BIC.

#### Residual Analysis: 
After fitting the model, analyze the residuals to ensure that there are no patterns (which would suggest that the model can be improved) and that the residuals are approximately normally distributed.

#### Validation: 
Validate the model using a hold-out sample or cross-validation to ensure that it performs well on unseen data.

#### Iterative Refinement: 
It is often an iterative process and may need to go back and forth adjusting the parameters and refitting the model until you find the best parameters for your specific dataset.
