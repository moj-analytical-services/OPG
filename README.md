# Overview of OPG projects
The spreadsheet models in question generate long-term forecasts (spanning from 2023 to 2029) for three critical areas of demand within the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG):

1. **Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs)**: These legal documents allow individuals to appoint someone they trust (an attorney) to make decisions on their behalf if they become unable to do so themselves. LPAs are essential for decision-making related to financial matters, health, and welfare.

2. **Deputyships**: Deputyships come into play when individuals lack an LPA or an Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA). A deputy is appointed by the Court of Protection to make decisions for someone who lacks mental capacity.

3. **Investigations**: The number of investigations conducted by the OPG depends on factors like the population of living LPA holders and the active deputyship caseload. These investigations ensure that attorneys and deputies act in the best interests of the person they represent.

These demand forecasts are crucial for several reasons:
- **Setting OPG Fees**: They inform fee structures, impacting the financial viability of the OPG.
- **Staffing Decisions**: They guide decisions on staffing levels and deployment, especially for specialist casework roles.
- **Resource Allocation**: They play a role in both short-term resource allocation and long-term strategic planning.

## Potential Unmet Need for LPAs
- Geographic disparities exist in LPA uptake. Some areas have low adoption rates, while others show indicators of potential need (e.g., high dementia prevalence).
- Defining potential need varies: Focusing on specific conditions (like dementia) or using age as an indicator leads to different conclusions.
- Existing OPG customers differ from communities with higher unmet needs.

## Why Don't People Take Out LPAs?
- Reasons are multifaceted and complex.
- Factors explored include age, ethnicity, geographic location, household income, mental health status, awareness, digital capability, and access to services.
- A behavioral model suggests that taking out an LPA depends on four conditions: Need, Drive, Awareness, and Accessibility.

## Modernizing LPAs
- This policy change will transform how customers purchase LPAs and how the OPG interacts with them.
- Long-term strategic concerns include assessing the impact on overall LPA demand and adapting to changing circumstances.

## Desirable Outputs:
1. **Short Term LPA Forecast**: 
    projections of 12 months or less of LPA applications received and numbers registered as a month profile. Frequency (to be agreed). Supports long term forecast.

2. **Long Term LPA Forecast**: 
    It is necessary to forecast LPA income, and forecast trends in deputyships an investigations. Long term projections (5 years +). Annual numbers of LPA applications received and registered with uncertainty ranges. Frequency: Annual updates. 

3. **Long Term Deputyships Forecast**: 
    necessary to forecast income from cases under active supervision, changes in the age structure of supervised cases and impact on remissions and exemptions; necessary to forecast investigations arising from deputyships. Long term projections (5 years +). Annual numbers of new deputyship cases, and numbers of cases under active supervision. Frequency: annual updates.  

4. **Long Term Investigations Forecast**: 
    necessary to understand resource demands (and costs) of expected increasing numbers of investigations from the rapidly rising numbers of existing LPA holders. Long term projections (5 years +) . Numbers pf projections split by origin LPAs, Deputyships , EPA and others.
