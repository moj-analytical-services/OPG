# Demand Forecasts for Deputyship

What we initially need to do is get an update of the available deputyship data. What we need to know is:
1.	The current active caseload ie those cases under active supervision
2.	The trend in the number of new deputyship orders

You can see below that Daniel started to follow this up last year.  The response from Stuart Stach was suggesting that the deputyship data is now being recorded in Sirius . Previously I had noted that deputyship “orders” had been recorded in the Sirius data that we received but this no longer seems to be the case, and what was recorded was not the level of detail previously available from CASREC (the database that previously captured deputyship data). I have included a file called “order1” derived from CASREC to give you an indication of the data fields actually required. What is needed is to go back to Stuart and others and obtain all of the data required to update the model, which it would be brilliant if you could do this.
